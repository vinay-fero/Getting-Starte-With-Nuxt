1. **nuxt-link-active**: class automatically added for active link.
2. **asyncData** - works only in the pages. It waits for the data to load and then send the page to client.
3. **this** keyword does not work inside the asyncData, as asyncData renders before the component.
4. **asyncData** is the alternative of data property in component which works asynchronously as well.
5. **nuxtServerInit**
